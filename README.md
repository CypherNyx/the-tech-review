## Description

This project is a CMS-style blog site that allows users to create, manage, and view blog posts. Users can visit the homepage to see existing blog posts, sign up using an email username and password, navigate to their dashboard, and log in to the site. Upon signing up or logging in, they gain access to navigation links for the homepage, dashboard, and logout option. Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts, leave comments on posts, and experience an idle timeout feature for added security and convenience.
